    Floods have been a part of life for all of human history, and are the most common type of natual disaster. In early Egypt, geometry developed as a way to redraw field boundaries after the annual flooding of the river Nile. Today, machine learning models and weather simulations are used to predict floods before they happen, enabling preventative measures that save lives and money.

    Companies like Fathom have mapped large portions of the US in detail, and developed floods maps for most of the country. These maps are useful in planning construction, since new buildings increase the impact of floods, and it is understood that building an office that is under 5 feet of water for a good chunck of the year is a bad idea.

    The modern abundance of data has made it possible for tech companies to become active in flood mitigation, leveraging a knowlege of computing that traditional engineering and research organisations do not have. In partnership with the Inidian government, Google has been developing a flood risk notification service that spans an area of 200 million people. It has also been publishing new forecasting models that combine fluid simulation with machine learning, taking advantage of the company's massive cloud computing resources.
