<p>In the age of online school, the use of computer science in education has never been more important. It is harder for teachers to check up
    on students, leading to some to fall behind. No one works at the same pace, in the same way. The use of "personalised learning" can even the playing field as everyone 
    can work in they way which is best for them. In classrooms, using apps encourages active particiapation, and can increase student engagement. This could be as simple as setting quizzes, or something
    bigger, such as using virtual reality to go on a virtual trip. This has been proven to increase knowledge retention.

    Technology allows people to take courses online. Many websites offer MOOCS (Massive Open Online Courses) which allow people to extend their skill set and learn
    about new topics which may not be taught in schools. People who may not have had access to education or had to leave school at a young age are able to learn online.
    This may then qualify them for new jobs, or promotions. An example of this is <a href = "www.open.ac.uk">The Open University</a>. The Open University permits work along side study,
    so people don't have to sacrifice a wage for an education. People can study from anywhere in the world, so they aren't limited to staying in a single geographical location either.

    There are some more basic ways technology improves education. Sources of information are easily accessable, making research easier and quicker. The use of email and video calling software (such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Skype)
    allow for quick communication so teachers can answer student questions quicker. Teachers themselves are able to access a wider range of resources, so can deliver a higher quality 
    teaching, as well as more interactive teaching. Teachers can share lesson plans and resources online. Countries all over the world can collaborate on education, helping countries
    with less education to have resources and to have better teacher training.
