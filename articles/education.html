<h2>Education</h2>
<p>In the age of online school, the use of computer science in education has never been more important. It is harder for teachers to check up
    on students, leading to some to fall behind. The use of "personalised learning" can even the playing field. Everyone can
    work at their own pace.

    Technology allows people from all over the world to work together, and collaborate on projects without ever having to meet face to face.

    Technology allows people to take courses online. The Open University allows people to study from all over the world, and allows flexible learning
    as courses are taught online. Similarly, many websites offer MOOCS (Massive Open Online Courses) which allow people to extend their skill set and
    learn stuff.
