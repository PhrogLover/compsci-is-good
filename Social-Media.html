                Social media is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives, particularly during COVID, allowing us to
                create and maintain relationships with many more people than we would be able to interact with in our daily
                lives. From finding you next job opportunity to your future spouse technology has boosted the realms of 
                human relationships far beyond what could have previously been imagined.

                From a psychological perspective it would make sense that theoretically social media
                would make people feel more connected to the world and others resulting in an overall 
                decrease in loneliness. However, a 2018 study evaluating exactly this found that not 
                all social media were equal in this idea. Since social media only has a positive effect
                when the user perceives social media as intimate and a good way of connecting to people
                whereas if the user was already lonely and they view social media as not particularly 
                intimate their social media use becomes more alienating than connecting. However social
                media has also increased people’s access to therapy and online support groups which
                also benefit these people who perhaps do not have the relevant or volume of resources 
                necessary to help them.

                There are many different ways that social media has changed people’s job prospects. As 
                social media itself has become its own job market with thousands of ‘influencers’ over
                various platforms, e.g. Instagram, YouTube, whose skills and backgrounds vary dramatically
                tapping into a brand-new style of marketing viable for almost any product. Whereas there is
                also professional focused social media which boosts peoples’ international career
                opportunities and professional networks. LinkedIn is incredibly popular with 660 million plus
                users as of 2020,  despite the fact LinkedIn is just a social media site it has created its
                own sector by having a more formal and professional image which differentiates itself from others
                and makes it the standard for professional social media.

                Due to COVID the world has been forced to isolate and work out ways to connect without being 
                physically in the same room but it has also simultaneously proved that business and socials can
                function and continue mostly (if not solely) online which could potentially open a whole world of
                possibilities in terms of working from home to a groups ability to function without a physical
                meeting place.
